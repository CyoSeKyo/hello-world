# hello-world
Hi Humans!

I'm Ryen, a junior student in UESTC，also a curious programmer.
It's my first time connect on GitHub, which is a magic and wonderful place to learn coding. 
I have met many giants，those who are highly skilled，talented and hard-working, on GitHub.
I venerate them and inspired myself to be stronger and stronger.
And I hope I could become one of them in one day. 
Throughout my programming road，I always think what I want and what I am working for.
Nowadays, the answer become a little clearer, but still a dim vision.
Only one thing I know very clearly is that，programming is our way to change the world!
It's also a long way, and I hope I can continue to go，go without loneliness.
May the world become a better place, because of programming.
May it be.
